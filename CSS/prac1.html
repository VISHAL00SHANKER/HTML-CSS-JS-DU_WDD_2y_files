    	<p>
      	Growing up in Texas, Chris Kyle is taught by his father how to shoot a rifle
      	and hunt deer. Years later, Kyle has become a ranch hand and rodeo cowboy,
      	and returns home early, to find his girlfriend in bed with another man.
      	After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he
      	sees news coverage of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and decides to enlist
      	in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a sniper with
      	the U.S. Navy SEALs.

      	After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he
      	sees news coverage of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and decides to enlist
      	in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a sniper with
      	the U.S. Navy SEALs.
    	</p>

    	<p>
      	Kyle is visibly upset by the experience, but later earns the nickname
      	"Legend" for his many kills. Assigned to hunt for the al-Qaeda leader,
      	Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Kyle interrogates a family whose father offers to
      	lead the SEALs to "The Butcher", al-Zarqawi's second-in-command.
    	</p>
    	
<p>
      	The plan goes awry when The Butcher captures the father and his son,
      	killing them while Kyle is pinned down by a sniper. This sniper goes by
      	the name Mustafa and is an Olympic Games medalist from Syria. Meanwhile,
      	the insurgents issue a bounty on Kyle.
    	</p>

    	<p>
      	Guilt compels Kyle to undertake a fourth tour, and Taya tells him she may
      	not be there when he returns. Back in Iraq, Kyle is shocked to learn
      	Biggles died in surgery to repair the wounds he sustained. Assigned to
      	kill Mustafa, who has been sniping U.S. Army combat engineers building
      	a barricade, Kyle's sniper team is placed on a rooftop inside enemy
      	territory. Kyle spots Mustafa and takes him out with a risky long distance
      	shot at 2,100 yards (1,920 m).
    	</p>

    	<p>
      	Kyle tearfully calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home.
      	A sandstorm provides cover for a chaotic escape in which Kyle is injured
      	and almost left behind.
    	</p>

    	<p>
      	After Kyle gets back, on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian
      	life, he is asked by a Veterans Affairs psychiatrist if he is
      	haunted by all the things he did in war.
    	</p>

    	<p>
      	When he replies it is "all the guys [he] couldn't save" that haunt him,
      	the psychiatrist encourages him to help severely wounded veterans in
      	the VA hospital. After that, Kyle gradually begins to adjust to home life.

      	Years later, on February 2, 2013, Kyle says goodbye to his wife and family
      	as he leaves in good spirits to spend time with Eddie Ray Routh, a
      	veteran suffering from PTSD at a shooting range.
